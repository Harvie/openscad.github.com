<h2>About OpenSCAD</h2>

<img src="images/openscad.png" width="100" align="left">

<p>
    <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> is software for creating
    solid 3D CAD models. It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX,
    Windows and Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
    OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. It reads a script containing a
    textual description of a 3D design and generates the model from that.
    This gives the designer full control over the modelling process and makes
    it possible to easily change any step in the modelling process or make
    designs that are defined by configurable parameters.
</p>

<p>
    OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is
    constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion of
    2D outlines.
</p>

<p>
    Source code is available via <a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad">github repository</a>
    and the existing documentation can be found on Wikibooks:

<p>
    <i>"The goal of <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/">Season of Docs</a>
    is to provide a framework for technical writers and open source projects
    to work together towards the common goal of improving an open source
    project's documentation. For technical writers who are new to open source,
    the program provides an opportunity to gain experience in contributing to
    open source projects. For technical writers who're already working in open
    source, the program provides a potentially new way of working together.
    Season of Docs also gives open source projects an opportunity to engage
    more of the technical writing community.</i>
</p>

<p>
    All the details about how it works including guides for both Technical
    Writers and Mentors are available from the main web site. The following
    links are just some short cuts for some of the most important pages.

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>
    The main area where OpenSCAD is used is designing and creating models for
    3D printing. There are even complete <a href="https://github.com/Metamaquina/Metamaquina2">3D printers</a>
    or <a href="https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/">CNC mills</a>
    designed in OpenSCAD, but the more common use case is for people to design
    "things" for their own use. Most notably <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>,
    a site hosting and sharing a huge amount of 3D printable designs uses
    OpenSCAD as base for it's Customizer which allows people to modify the
    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/customizable/">parametric designs</a>
    uploaded there to fit their needs and print those.
</p>

<p>
    There are lots of other possible uses though, including math art like the
    <a href="https://mathgrrl.com/hacktastic/2018/11/the-snowflake-machine-2/">Snowflake Machine</a>
    by Laura Taalman and the <a href="http://kitwallace.co.uk/3d/knot.xq?knot-number=&selected-knot=2&components=1&crossings=&id=&action=view">Knot</a>

</ul>

We are also open for discussion about other documentation topics that could be
covered in scope of the Google Season of Docs rules.

<h3 id="education">Create an OpenSCAD Introduction for use in Education</h3>

<p>
    As can be seen in various posts on social media, OpenSCAD is already used
    in education. So far there is not much support for this, neither in form
    of specific documentation or examples included in the releases.
</p>

<p>
    Ideally the introduction would be structured in a way that it covers
    different topics in a modular way, so new modules covering other use
    cases can be added later while still maintaining the overall structure
    of the document.
</p>

<p>
    An important part of this documentation would be multiple examples showing
    each of the features taught in a module along with some suggested homework
    style questions & answers.
</p>

<p>
    Possible topics to cover, other/more suggestions welcome:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Math Art</li>
    <li>Recursive functions</li>
    <li>Visualization of Geometry</li>
    <li>Graphical display of sequences (fibonacci)</li>
    <li>All about vectors</li>
    <li>Platonic solids</li>
    <li>Creating 3D shapes</li>
    <li>Simple animations for Physics</li>
</ul>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Target Audience</th>
        <td>Educators using the introduction for courses or as base for their own scripts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Scope</th>
        <td>The documentation should initially cover maybe 2 or 3 different topics and should be structured in a way to be extensible later with other topics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Current state</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Expected license</th>
        <td>CC-BY-SA or similar, code snippets must be CC0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="tipstricks">Create an interactive Tips & Tricks Guide for OpenSCAD</h3>

<p>
    We have a <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Tips_and_Tricks">Tips & Tricks guide</a>
    which is meant to help users with various skill level by providing
    code snippets for topics that come up multiple times. This includes
    simple coding techniques for calculating values like selectively counting
    values in a list or geometric topics like stacking different sized
    objects.
</p>

<p>
    The main idea for this project is to provide a framework for presenting
    the tips in a more interactive way using standard web techniques. This
    would either pick a number of existing tips or create some new ones based
    on research on sites like the <a href="https://forum.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD forum</a>,
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/openscad">StackOverflow</a>,
    the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openscad/">OpenSCAD subreddit</a>
    and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/openscad/forums/general">Thingiverse Discussion Group</a>.
    Interactive in that context means to break down the more complex tips
    into smaller steps and present them to the user in a way that it's
    possible to interactively move though the steps and maybe also modify
    some of the parameters on the way.
</p>

<p>
    The resulting documentation would be expected to be similar to a screenplay
    or script showing both the content and the interaction with the user.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Target Audience</th>
        <td>New or novice users who are not fully confident using just the reference manual. Some basic language knowledge is assumed, so it's not expected to present very core concepts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Scope</th>
        <td>A selection of tips and tricks with medium to complex difficulty which can be broken down into multiple steps and visualized in a way that makes them easier to understand and apply to other designs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Current state</th>
        <td>No presentation exists yet, but there is a list of Tips & Tricks collected on the Wikimedia page.<br><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Tips_and_Tricks">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Tips_and_Tricks</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Expected license</th>
        <td>CC-BY-SA or similar, code snippets must be CC0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="usermanual">Improve the OpenSCAD User Manual</h3>

<p>
    The OpenSCAD User Manual is maintained at Wikibooks which has the benefit
    that users can easily contribute changes but it does mean less control
    regarding what's documented and changed. The manual is usable and has
    some basic information, but is not that well structured and also skips
    over some important topics.
</p>

<p>
    It's ok to propose a new workflow / hosting for the documentation if
    there's a good argument for that which promises also long term
    maintenance.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Target Audience</th>
        <td>All users of the OpenSCAD (the application including the built-in editor, customizer and animation features), so the manual should cover the most important scenarios and features of the application.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Scope</th>
        <td>Scope of the manual is to explain the possibilities the user interface gives (as opposed to the modelling language which is covered by the Language Manual).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Current state</th>
        <td>Bits and Pieces exist but it's not well structured and is in part written with too much focus on the developer perspective<br><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Expected license</th>
        <td>CC-BY-SA or similar, code snippets must be CC0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="refmanual">Improve the OpenSCAD Language Reference Manual</h3>

<p>
    The OpenSCAD Language Reference Manual together with the Language Cheat
    Sheet is an important resource when creating OpenSCAD designs as it
    collects information about all built-in language features and descriptions
    of the parameters available. For newer features the manual also started
    to collect the information which version of OpenSCAD is required for
    specific features. This can be very important for users that need to
    target a specific OpenSCAD version, e.g. the one used by the Thingiverse
    Customizer.
</p>

<p>
    The current version of this manual is quite usable and should cover
    almost all the functions and modules that are available. There is
    still lots of room for improvement like unifying the writing style
    and creating better images showing the result of the examples. One
    interesting option would be to automatically generate parts of the
    documentation (text structure and/or images). Alternatively a set of
    rules for generating new entries could already help a lot.
</p>

<p>
    It's ok to propose a new workflow / hosting for the documentation if
    there's a good argument for that which promises also long term
    maintenance.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Target Audience</th>
        <td>All users of OpenSCAD who create new or modify existing designs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Scope</th>
        <td>Scope of the manual is to explain every bulit-in language feature in detail in a clearly structured way. Ideally there should be cross references for features that can be used in multiple contexts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Current state</th>
        <td>Relatively complete and reasonably structured documentation exists, but it's lacking a single style, clear references and a good list of examples with reference pictures.<br><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual</a><br>Cheat Sheet: <a href="https://openscad.org/cheatsheet/">https://openscad.org/cheatsheet/</a> - (<a href="https://openscad.org/cheatsheet/snapshot.html">development version</a>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Expected license</th>
        <td>CC-BY-SA or similar, code snippets must be CC0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="tutorial">Extend the OpenSCAD Tutorial with advanced topics</h3>

<p>
    In scope of GSoD 2019 a nice introduction tutorial was created. It can be
    found at <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_Tutorial">Wikibooks - OpenSCAD Tutorial</a>.
    This covers most of the core features and mentions some of the more
    advanced topics but goes not too much into details there.
</p>

<p>
    Some topics that could be included:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>More detailed coverage of using libraries</li>
    <li>Structure designs for easier maintenance</li>
    <li>Write reusable code and libraries</li>
    <li>Performance considerations for bigger designs</li>
    <li>Designs with multiple parts and assembly view</li>
    <li>Using the animation feature</li>
</ul>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Target Audience</th>
        <td>People who already have some knowledge of OpenSCAD and want to go the next step towards more complicated designs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Scope</th>
        <td>At the end of the advanced tutorial the user should have the knowledge to create and maintain complex models.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Current state</th>
        <td>Introduction tutorial exists covering most core features and only touching on some more advanced topics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Expected license</th>
        <td>CC-BY-SA or similar, code snippets must be CC0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="video">Video introduction to the OpenSCAD GUI</h3>

<p>
    Due to the fact that OpenSCAD is script based, it does not have a very
    complicated GUI. The core GUI is basically a text editor for writing the
    code of the 2D or 3D designs. However there are a number of features that
    are not obvious but can help the user to work much more efficiently.
    In addition to special features, an overview of the common workflow of
    developing and analyzing a design would be useful.
</p>

<p>A some topics that could be covered:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Full workflow from design to export</li>
    <li>Using the different view modes</li>
    <li>Visual aids for debugging a design</li>
    <li>Changing numbers via ALT+Cursor keys</li>
    <li>Using the Customizer</li>
</ul>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Target Audience</th>
        <td>Depending on the topic either beginner or advanced users.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Scope</th>
        <td>Short and self contained introductions of specific topics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Current state</th>
        <td>No official video documentation exists, but YouTube has lots of tutorials and stream recordings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Expected license</th>
        <td>CC-BY-SA or similar, code snippets must be CC0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    When selecting this project, please also provide examples of previous work
    on video tutorials.
